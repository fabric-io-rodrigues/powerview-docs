1. Menu
2. Workspace
3. Selection panel
4. Simulation panel
5. Values panel

## Menu

The menu provides extra functionalities, which are described below.

### View menu

* Refresh: refreshes the workspace with the current selected variables
* Show selection panel: show/hides the selection panel
* Show simulation panel: shows/hides the simulation panel
* Show values panel: shows/hides the values panel.
* Hide all panels: hides all panels and show only the workspace area.
* Circuit exhibition mode:
  * Schematic diagram: represents the circuits as continuous straight lines connnecting their terminal buses.
  * Geo-referenced: represents the circuits as continuous segments connecting each onde of the informed coordinates along the circuit path. The circuits without read coordinates available are represented schematically as a straight dashed line.

### Geographical coordinates menu

* Generate coordinates: uses an internal algorithm to generate artificial coordinates for all buses, replacing the current ones. This is convenient for a preliminary analysis in case the real coordinates are not available

### Search menu

* Search bus: searches for a bus and place it on the center of the workspace.
