## Welcome to Power View

Power View is a tool for the graphical visualization of transmission-related study results of PSR models. This tool allows the visualization on a map, in a georeferenced and integrated environment, of animated circuit flows, circuit loading, as as bus-related information such as bus generation and load. Is is also possible to show an animated chronological evolution of the variables along the study period.

### Technical specifications

The visualization tool has been implemented using the *Adobe AIR* framework (based on *Adobe Flash*) and the *Google Maps* API.

* *Adobe AIR*: graphical development framework based on vector graphics, which allows the construction of rich content applications using high performance graphical processing. Its main characteristics are:
  * GPU Hardware acceleration for performance optimization
  * Layer-bases interface layout
  * Vector animation support
  * Rasterized graphics animation

* *Google Maps API*: Power View integration with *Google Maps* API allows the use of navigation and control functionalities such as:
  * Terrain map visualization
  * Type of terrain visualization
  * Translation and zoom control
